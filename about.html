            <h2>About Refab Workshop</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Refab Workshop! As someone with a passion for both architecture and woodworking, I found solace in tinkering with wood during the COVID-19 lockdowns. What started as a simple hobby quickly blossomed into something more meaningful as I discovered the joy of restoring and upcycling old furniture.</p>

            <p>The name "Refab Workshop" means to take outdated furniture and make it fabulous again. Equipped with a full array of tools and resources, Refab Furniture is dedicated to the repair and restoration of all kinds of furniture. From sanders to spray painting equipment, we have everything needed to give each piece a professional finish.</p>
                
            <p>Our process begins with scouring platforms like Facebook Marketplace and TradeMe for hidden gems waiting to be revitalized. Once in our workshop, these pieces are stripped down, sanded, and refinished with care. Whether it's a fresh coat of paint to add a pop of color or a clear finish to highlight the beautiful wood grain, I strive to bring out the best in each piece.</p>
                
            <p>Join us at Refab Workshop as we breathe new life into old furniture and create pieces that are both beautiful and functional. Let us help you transform your space with our unique and sustainable approach to furniture restoration.</p>
